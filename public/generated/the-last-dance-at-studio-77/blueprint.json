The confrontation turned violent, and Celeste used his scarf to defend herself, killing him in the process. She slipped out the back to the alley, where she disposed of a bar rag she used to wipe her trembling, sweaty hands. She returned to her post, but her nerves were shot, causing her to mess up Bianca Sterling's drink order just minutes after the murder. The scent of her perfume on the scarf and the rag in the dumpster confirms her presence and actions. It wasn't a premeditated plan, but a desperate act by a woman with no other way out."
