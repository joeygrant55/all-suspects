    "killerId": "jian-li",
    "method": "Jian stole Marcus Cole's security keycard earlier in the day. After confirming Thorne was falsifying data, Jian put a plan for revenge into motion. Jian used a lab sonic emitter to create a nearly invisible stress fracture in the locking mechanism of a spare EVA helmet. Jian then lured Dr. Thorne to Airlock 3 under the pretense of a sensor malfunction on the outer hull, insisting he see it for himself. While Thorne suited up, Jian swapped his helmet for the sabotaged one. Once Thorne was inside the airlock, Jian initiated the cycle from a nearby panel. The pressure change caused the fractured seal to fail catastrophically. During the 90-second cycle, Jian used the stolen keycard to wipe the local security log before returning to the lab via a service duct.",
    "motive": "This was not a spontaneous crime but a deeply personal act of vengeance. Dr. Thorne's flawed research was directly responsible for the death of Jian's entire family in a colony disaster on Mars years ago. When Jian discovered that Thorne was not only unrepentant but was now falsifying data to push forward a similarly flawed project, risking countless more lives, Jian felt a moral obligation to stop him permanently. It was justice for the past and protection for the future.",
    "explanation": "While many had reasons to hate Dr. Thorne, only Jian Li had the motive, means, and opportunity. The affair with Lena Petrova and the financial troubles with Anya Sharma were powerful red herrings. Marcus Cole's missing keycard and public disdain for the victim made him an obvious suspect. However, the true story is rooted in the past. Jian's personnel file reveals the original tragedy. The falsified data proves Thorne hadn't changed, providing the catalyst. The sonic emitter from the lab is the murder weapon, linking directly to Jian's work. Jian's quiet, unassuming nature provided the perfect cover for a meticulously planned execution. The stolen keycard was used to frame Marcus, a man Jian knew also despised Thorne."
