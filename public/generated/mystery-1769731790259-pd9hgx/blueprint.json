Vera saw Ruby leave Tommy's office at 11:15 with her dress torn, correctly deducing that Tommy had assaulted her. Having grown fond of Ruby (seeing her younger self in her), Vera decided to complete her 'assignment' early. She used the letter opener she had taken at 10:45 PM, entered through the office door (not the window as she later claimed), killed Tommy, and left. She then established her alibi by claiming to be in the ladies' lounge. When she returned at 11:35 through the window (her signature move), it was theater - she was checking her work and establishing her professional assassin persona to misdirect suspicion."

You were hired by Vincent Torrino to kill Tommy, but you've grown fond of this place and these people - it reminds you of a life you could have had. You arrived at 10:30, cased the joint, and noticed Tommy's letter opener on his desk when you passed by at 10:45. You took it then, planning to use it later. At 11:35, you entered through the back office window (your calling card - you always enter unexpectedly). You found Tommy already dead, which annoyed you greatly - no payment for a job not done. You left immediately through the same window. You always carry a knife in your garter but prefer to use the target's own possessions. When people get too close to the truth, you deflect with cryptic statements.",
