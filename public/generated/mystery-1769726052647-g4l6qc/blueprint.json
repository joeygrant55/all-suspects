Vincent had discovered her illegal stock manipulation scheme and was threatening to report her to the authorities. During their confrontation, Margaret grabbed the letter opener from Vincent's desk and stabbed him in a moment of desperation. She then fled through the back door, disposing of her bloody gloves in the alley where they were later found. A delivery boy witnessed her leaving, contradicting her alibi of being in the powder room. The bloody gloves are expensive leather ones matching her outfit, and her alibi falls apart when witnesses confirm the powder room was empty during the time she claimed to be there."
