    "killerId": "lola-lulu-dubois",
    "method": "Lola arranged to meet Silas in the VIP lounge, ostensibly to make a blackmail payment. Once they were alone, she confronted him, begging him to leave her past alone. He laughed at her, enjoying his power. In a moment of panic and desperation, she pulled the small .25 caliber pistol Vinnie had given her for protection and shot him once in the chest. She dropped the gun in shock, but quickly recovered it, wiped it down, and fled back to her dressing room to hide it before her next set.",
    "motive": "Silas had discovered Lola's true identity from a dark past in New Orleans, where she was connected to the death of a previous lover. He was blackmailing her, threatening to expose her to Vinnie. Knowing Vinnie's violent jealousy and hatred of secrets, she knew the revelation would lead him to cast her out, or worse. She killed Silas to permanently silence him, protecting her new life and her relationship with Vinnie at any cost.",
    "explanation": "While many had motives, only Lola's story fits all the facts. Vinnie and Franklin have iron-clad alibis. The evidence against Beatrice (the note and cigarette case) and Vinnie (the torn manifest) are classic red herrings—strong motives, but no opportunity. Mitch O'Connell was desperate but was seen by dozens of people behind the bar. Lola's alibi, however, is a lie. Mitch saw her heading towards the lounge just before the murder. Franklin's testimony about the 'songbird' comment points directly to her. The most damning physical evidence is the single blue sequin found at the scene, which matches a spare dress in her room, proving her presence. This, combined with Ruby's testimony connecting her to the pearl-handled pistol and the discovery of the recently-fired murder weapon hidden in her hatbox, seals her guilt."
