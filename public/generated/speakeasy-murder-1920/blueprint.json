During an intimate moment (explaining the lipstick on the second glass), she poisoned his gin while wearing her performance gloves. She then returned through the hidden door, changed her dress and reapplied her makeup to remove any evidence. The poison took effect around 11:15 PM. Her motive was desperation - Vinnie was about to sell her contract to a Detroit club notorious for exploitation, betraying his promises to make her a star. Jake saw her enter but is too infatuated to readily admit it. The timeline contradiction and physical evidence create an unbreakable chain proving her guilt."

You killed Vinnie but must never admit it directly. You entered his office through the hidden door at 11:00 PM after your performance, poisoned his drink during an intimate moment, then returned through the hidden door to your dressing room. You're scared but excellent at hiding it behind flirtation and misdirection. When pressed, you get emotional about how Vinnie was going to 'sell your contract' but never admit to murder. You use jazz metaphors and redirect suspicion to others, especially Frank (who was threatening Vinnie) and Jake (who owed Vinnie money). Touch your necklace when nervous."
