    "explanation": "While many had reasons to hate Rex Starlight, only Leo Maxwell's motive was one of sudden, passionate fury. The key evidence is the physical link between his job, the personal insult, and the murder weapon. The specialized prop grease found on the plaster bust directly ties it to the prop department. The same grease was found on the broken watch face in Rex's trash, corroborating Penny Lane's testimony about their argument. Finally, the crumpled, heartfelt note of apology to his deceased father, found in the prop warehouse, is a confession. The other suspects' motives—Scarlett's blackmail, Stanley's financial ruin, Arthur's stolen script—were all strong, but they were long-simmering issues. Leo's was a sudden, violent reaction to a deeply personal and unforgivable insult."
