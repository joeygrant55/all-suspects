After he passed out, around 9:45 PM, she shot him in the chest with a small .25 caliber pistol she'd brought in a hidden compartment in her medical bag. She wiped the gun clean, placed it near his hand, then used a stiff wire (a common tool in her bag for setting bones) to engage the lock on the door from the outside as she left, making it seem locked from within.",
    "motive": "Lord Alistair Blackwood's first wife died years ago under Dr. Reed's care. It was a fatal malpractice error that Reed successfully covered up. Recently, Blackwood uncovered the truth and began blackmailing her. The night of the murder, he was about to expose her, which would have meant the end of her career and her freedom. She killed him to ensure his silence.",
    "explanation": "Dr. Evelyn Reed cultivated an image of the trustworthy, professional physician, which gave her unparalleled access and opportunity. When Lord Blackwood threatened to reveal her darkest secret, she saw only one way out. Her alibi of leaving at 9:30 PM is contradicted by the butler, Arthur Vance, who saw her leaving the corridor closer to 9:45 PM. The sedative in the brandy explains why no one heard a struggle and why the Lord couldn't defend himself. The blackmail letter fragment in the fireplace confirms the motive, and the hidden compartment in her medical bag, combined with her medical journal open to a page on Chloral Hydrate, solidifies her as the killer. The other suspects had strong motives\u2014rage, revenge, and greed\u2014but only Dr. Reed had the unique combination of means, motive, and opportunity, all pointing to a desperate act of self-preservation disguised as a simple murder."
