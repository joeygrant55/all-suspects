She harvested the roots to create a concentrated Aconite poison. Before the séance, while serving refreshments, she added a fatal, tasteless dose to Madame Evangeline's personal water glass, knowing her mistress would sip from it during her 'trance.' The poison induced rapid cardiac arrest, mimicking a fainting spell or spiritual shock.",
    "motive": "After a decade of abuse and complicity, Beatrice discovered that Evangeline had booked a one-way ticket to France, planning to flee with their entire fortune and leave Beatrice behind to face the angry, defrauded clients. It was not just revenge for years of cruelty, but a desperate act to prevent her own ruin and seize the wealth she felt she had earned. She planned to frame one of the wealthy attendees.",
    "explanation": "The killer is Beatrice Holloway. Her meek demeanor was a mask for a cunning and resentful mind. Her motive is revealed by her diary and the train ticket receipt, which shows Evangeline was abandoning her. The method is pieced together through the book on poisonous plants, the empty vial with her small fingerprints found in the conservatory, and the damning gardening gloves in her room covered in Monkshood pollen. Her false testimony against Dr. Crowe was a deliberate attempt to mislead the investigation. While Lord Alistair and others had strong motives, only Beatrice had the specific knowledge of the poison, the access to the victim's glass, and the overwhelming motive of ultimate betrayal."
