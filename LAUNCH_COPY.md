Hey r/WebGames!

I built a noir detective game where you interrogate AI suspects to solve a murder. Unlike scripted games, these suspects actually adapt to your questions - they lie, get nervous, contradict each other, and crack under pressure.

**What makes it different:**
- AI-powered conversations (Claude) - ask anything
- Suspects remember previous statements and can slip up
- Pressure system - push too hard and they clam up
- Find contradictions between witness statements
- 1920s noir setting

**Play free:** https://allsuspects.slateworks.io

Still early - would love feedback on the difficulty and what works/doesn't work.

Been working on this for a few months - a murder mystery game where the suspects are AI-powered, so they actually think about your questions and try to deceive you.

Set in 1929 at a New Year's Eve party gone wrong. You interrogate 6 suspects, collect evidence, find contradictions, and make your accusation.

What I'm most proud of:
- Suspects genuinely adapt to your investigation
- Catch them lying by cross-referencing statements
- Pressure mechanic that makes guilty suspects nervous
- New procedural mystery generator (beta)

Looking for feedback on gameplay feel and difficulty.

**Title:** Built a detective game using Claude AI as the NPCs - they genuinely try to deceive you

Wanted to explore what happens when you give AI characters secrets and motivations instead of just making them assistants.

Built a murder mystery game where 6 suspects are powered by Claude. They have hidden knowledge, relationships with each other, and actually try to lie/deflect when you get close to the truth.

The interesting part: they remember their previous statements and can contradict themselves if you push them. Some players have caught lies I didn't even anticipate.

Play it: https://allsuspects.slateworks.io

Would love to hear what other interactive AI experiments people are working on.

I built a detective game where 6 murder suspects are powered by Claude. Instead of scripted dialogue trees, you can ask anything and they respond in character.

The interesting technical bits:
- Each character has hidden knowledge/secrets that influence their responses
- Contradiction detection compares statements across all suspects
- Pressure system tracks how aggressively you're interrogating
- Characters remember their previous statements and can slip up

The goal was to see if AI NPCs could create genuinely emergent gameplay - where players catch suspects in lies the developer never explicitly scripted.

Stack: React + Express + Claude API

Would love feedback, especially on:
- Whether the AI "feels" like an actual suspect vs a chatbot
- Difficulty balancing
- Ideas for making lies more detectable

Code isn't open source yet but happy to discuss the architecture.
