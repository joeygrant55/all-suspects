 * 
 * Setting: March 15th, 1947 - The Palladium Theatre, Hollywood
 * Victim: Victor Malone, legendary film director
 * 
 * During the premiere of "Shadows Over Sunset," Victor Malone is found
 * strangled in the projection room. The killer used a strip of film
 * from one of Gloria Fontaine's old silent pictures - poetic justice
 * for a man who destroyed her career when she refused his advances.
 * 
 * Six suspects, all with secrets, all with motives.
 * Only one is guilty.
